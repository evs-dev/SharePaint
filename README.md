https://evs-dev.github.io/SharePaint

## Usage

### In PICO-8

#### Controls

- Arrow Keys: Move selection
- X: Paint
- C: Change mode (painting, colour selection, tool selection)
- Enter: Open pause menu

#### Tools

- Paint Brush: Paints a single pixel
- Paint Bucket: Flood fills all the pixels of the same colour connected to the current pixel

#### Saving a Painting

To save a painting, open the pause menu (Enter or the small rectangular button on mobile), select "`SAVE PIXELS`", and press enter/X. The page will reload and the URL will be updated with your painting. You can now copy the URL to share.

### URL Parameters

Here are the current URL parameters:
- `pixels` - the pixel data encoded with run-length encoding. Letters correspond to PICO-8 colours (A = 0 = black, H = 7 = white, etc.). Numbers are the run lengths. If there is no number following a letter, the number is presumed to be 1 unless the letter is the last character, in which case it stretches to the end of the canvas.
- `outline` - whether or not the selection outline is visible by default (0 = invisible, >0 = visible). The outline hides itself automatically after 4 seconds of inactivity, and reappears as soon as a button is pressed. This parameter only affects the start state.

Here is an example of a URL:

https://evs-dev.github.io/SharePaint?pixels=c36o2c4o2c7o4c2o4c5o8h2o2c4o9ho2c5o10c6io9c6io9c7io7c9io4ic11i4c&outline=0

which results in this:

<a href="https://evs-dev.github.io/SharePaint?pixels=c36o2c4o2c7o4c2o4c5o8h2o2c4o9ho2c5o10c6io9c6io9c7io7c9io4ic11i4c&outline=0">

## Technical Details

SharePaint is a combination of [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/) and [PICO-8 Lua](https://pico-8.fandom.com/wiki/Lua). `pixelsLoader.js` uses the flexible and well-documented aspects of the save format of PICO-8 to modify `_cartdat` in `sharepaint.js` (the file generated by PICO-8 that contains all cartridge data) as the cartridge loads on the website using the URL parameters.

`index.html` is generated by PICO-8 and is responsible for running `sharepaint.js`, as well as site responsiveness, on-screen controls for mobile, etc. It is modified only to run the `loadPixels()` function (from `pixelsLoader.js`) as it loads the cartridge. Fortunately, this file doesn't need to be regenerated when changes are made to the PICO-8 app, meaning it can remain untouched even after updates.

The [run-length encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run-length_encoding) decoding performed by `loadPixels()` should be fairly self-explanatory. As said above, letters correspond to PICO-8 colours (A = 0 = black, H = 7 = white, etc.), while numbers are the run lengths. The encoding is done by `save_pixels()` in `sharepaint.p8`.
